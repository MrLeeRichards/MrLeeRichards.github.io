            This site as a whole doesn't really have a specific purpose, but it has
            become a convenient place for me to put some more specific and intentional
            content. For the time being, this content has to do with Procedural Content
            Generation (PCG), a perennial fascination of mine. The first few are demos of some
            fairly basic algorithms that are already fairly well known in the PCG domain.
            The real highlight will probably end up being the sub-site, Effective Procedural
            Content Generation.
