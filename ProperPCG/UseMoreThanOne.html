            This one is interesting, because the benefit it gives is very subtle, so subtle that
            whether you need pay this principle any heed may well depend on how often the player
            is seeing the content a given PCG engine generates. Generally, it's safe to assume
            that if there's an unbroken pattern in the content being generated, the player will
            pick up on it, consciously or subconsciously, and this may break the illusion you
            may have been intending to create of the content being hand-crafted. Now, this illusion
            isn't always a goal for a PCG system, and if not, no harm done. Often, however, you would
            like to give the impression that a particular piece of content was designed, or arose
            organically out of the game world. In such cases, there are still patterns, to be sure,
            but they don't hold with the same regularity as algorithmically generated ones do.
         </p>
         <p>
            Let me give you an example of what I mean. Have a look at this name generator:
         </p>
         <span id="spanOneGenerator"></span>
         <p>
            After a few seconds of observation, you may not be able to reverse engineer the algorithm,
            but I imagine you've picked up on the basic structure of the content, and more importantly,
            the fact that it's being generated algorithmically. I think it's reasonable to assume that,
            given enough examples (and probably fewer than you'd expect), your players would do the same.
            That's the sort of thing we would like to overcome. Now, take a look at this one:
         </p>
         <span id="spanMultipleGenerators"></span>
         <p>
            Since you've already seen the first generator in action, you probably recognize some of these names
            already. However, many of them, I imagine, fall outside of that expectation, and if you hadn't seen
            the generator isolated, you might not have been able to distinguish it to begin with. See if you
            can discern, just by watching, how many generators are involved.
         </p>
         <a id="aAnswer">Answer...</a>
         <p id="pAnswer" style="display: none;">
            In fact, there are only four. There is the one you've already seen, which selects from a bank of first
            syllables, last syllables, and plugs in a random vowel for both. The second is a simple pattern of random
            vowel, two random consonants (not all consonants. That's asking for trouble), another vowel, a consonant,
            a vowel, and maybe one more consonant if it feels like it. The third is a Markov Model based on a
            list of common British surnames. I will hopefully have demo-ed Markov Models at some point on this website.
            Until then, here's an excellent <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Markov+Chains" target="_blank">article</a> on the topic.
            The last "generator" is simply a random selection from an actual list of common British surnames.
         </p>
         <p>
            Hopefully this illustrates the point. There are patterns in the names being generated above, but they
            are less like the patterns that we expect to be generated by an algorithm, and more like the patterns
            we would expect to see in a list of actual human names, and that's the key. Intelligently designed content
            isn't random, but neither is it completely predictable, and the simplest way to approximate that, for my
            money, is creating multiple, simple generators for a particular type of content.
