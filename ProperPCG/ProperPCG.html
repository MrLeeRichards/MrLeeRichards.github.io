      <h2>Effective Procedural Content Generation</h2>
      <div class="TextSection">
         <p>
            Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is a deceptively magical concept.
            You leave some blanks in your game's content where you can plug in some random
            number generators, and poof! Infinite replay value! Just about any type of content
            can be treated this way. Need a color scheme for an opposing faction? Plug random number generators
            into your RGB channels, and you've got the entire range of possible color schemes embedded
            into your game. Want a new level for your dungeon? Pre-fabricate some elements and randomly
            throw them onto the grid. Need enemies for that dungeon? You've got stats for strength,
            health, mana, luck, and so on, that are just begging for some pseudo-random goodness.
            Names, puzzles, weapons, even story plots are all just data. Define the space of possibilities,
            and traverse the space at run-time. The world is your oyster...
         </p>
         <p>
            ... And just like any other apparently magical technique, the people who use it can be tempted to forget
            the obvious. Procedural Content Generation can be done badly, and it has been. If you plug in random
            numbers and choices anywhere they fit, you may indeed create something fun to play, and indeed,
            a chimpanzee on a type-writer may occassionally create something fun (or indeed possible) to read.
            However, if you want your PCG engine to produce engaging content consistently, you need to apply
            constraints that will increase the chances of that happening.

            I don't claim to be an expert on PCG. I certainly don't have any credentials to that effect (I don't even
            know if someone can obtain credentials in PCG), but I don't think that what I have to say is really
            about PCG as such. It's more about not using PCG as a substitute for creativity or design sense.
            Everything I will say after this point is briefly comprehended in this principle: If you are allowing a
            process to make random choices, present it only with good choices. So, with this in mind, here is my
            perpetually incomplete list of principles for effective PCG. Let me stress that these are principles. A
            principle I would define as something that you might want try first, and might want to consider trying
            again when free-styling isn't working out for you.
