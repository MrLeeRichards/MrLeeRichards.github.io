            Let's start with a simple example. Suppose you need a three-color scheme for a faction of space pirates.
            How would you go about it? Well, each color is three channels with a range of 0 to 255 (or more, if you want
            to ... print some extremely high-fidelity screen caps?). So, that's nine orders of Math.floor(Math.random() * 256),
            right?, Well you could do that, and if you did, it would generate results like this:
         </p>
         <canvas id="canUnconstrained" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
         <p>
            Delightful! Occasionally. But mostly not. If your possibility space contains all possible
            combinations of all possible colors, it will by definition happen to contain combinations of
            colors that look good. It will also contain the (infinitely larger) space of color combos which look
            nonsensical. So, as I said, you have to constrain the selection space to the color combinations that
            look good.
         </p>
         <p>
            How do we go about doing that? Well in the case of our three-color scheme dilemma, we have the benefit of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_theory">color theory</a>, an umbrella name for a set of principles defining what combinations of colors tend
            to look most pleasing to the greatest number of people. Obviously, it's a complex topic, but let's see
            how much of an improvement we can get out of applying the most basic ideas from it. Let's pick
            a hue at random (select from a range of 0 to 360). This will be our main color. Then we'll randomly
            select one of three types of color schemes, complementary (not complimentary), analogous, or monochrome,
            and derive our other two colors from that. We'll also make one lighter and one darker than our main color,
            to emphasize it more. If we go about it in that way, we get results like this:
         </p>
         <canvas id="canConstrained" width="200" height="100"></canvas>
         <p>
            Now we're cooking. Granted, even with this scheme in place, not all of them are winners. Some of the
            analogous ones especially can still be a little bit puke-ish. Also, all hues are not created equal. Hues that
            are firmly on the warm or cool side of the wheel tend to make better main color choices, and some hues
            are perceived as lighter or darker than others, even if they technically have the same value. Also, this
            generation scheme doesn't allow for things like pastel (easter egg) color schemes, or greyscale, or color
            schemes derived from association rather than theory (e.g. rich greens and low saturation browns aren't 
            theoretically "correct", but they have a strong association with nature that makes them familiar and acceptable).
         </p>
         <p>
            The point I'm trying to make is this. Don't make a purely random selection if your selection process could be
            more informed. If you've already picked a color, you now have the data needed to do something more deliberate than
            using the same random process to pick another color. If you've generated a region's geography and climate, and
            you're now in the process of picking out the inhabitants' clothes, don't randomly select from the entire
            potential wardrobe. You know which climate your inhabitants are inhabiting, so dress them accordingly!
            Don't give them beachware if they're living in a tundra!
         </p>
         <p>
            In short, think about the context of what your generating. The more of the context your PCG engine factors
            into its selection process, the more intentional its choices will appear, and the more cohesive the
            resulting experience will be. You can take this principle even further. Generate data that never
            manifests in a way the player directly experiences, but gives you something from which to derive.
            For example, if you have a family for which you want to generate members, generate some stats for that
            family (e.g. average height, average weight, average hair color, average wealth, etc.). There's no need
            to put a character with those exact stats in the game, but you can generate apples that fall close to the
            proverbial tree that you've generated. One way or another, if you want to pull together the experience,
            give your generator more inputs than just a random number.
